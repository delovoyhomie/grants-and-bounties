# Grant program guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

- It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

## Areas of interests
An overview of existing TON projects can be found in [TON Ecosystem map](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map)

### Infrastructure [WIP]

- Web IDE (we have https://nujan.io/, but we need some one else)
- API Provider (for GraphQL & Event Streaming)
- Web3 OAuth 
- Healthcheck & Monitoring for Nodes
- Self-Deployed Node Images for Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, etc.)

### DeFi

[WIP]

### GameFi [WIP]
❗️Note
</br>
Full-fledged games are not supported via our general grant program. We've tailored a specific [GameFi](ton.org/gamefi) center providing technical support, marketing aid, and even investment opportunities. From weekly calls to help with game integration to social media boosts at launch, and scaling through Telegram Ad Grants—our support is comprehensive.
</br>
- Scolarship (e.g., YGG)
- Rarity tools (e.g., rarity.tools)
- NFT Lending (e.g., nftfi.com) (we already have Daolama, but would be great to help them with liquidity or attract one of big players) 
- HTML5 Engines Support (we need a partner ready to work on Cocos2d support for TON libraries and tools) – maybe John can help with that
- Meta transactions, account abstraction, gasless onboarding (Solana metaplex?
  
## Grant project requirements

### Open-source technical projects:

- All code produced as part of this category of grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.
