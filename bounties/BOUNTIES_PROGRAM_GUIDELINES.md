## How to Propose a Bounty
**Ideation Stage**
1. Open a [**bounty issue**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/new?assignees=&labels=footstep&template=Footstep.yaml). Name it using the name of your proposal.
2. Fill the issue form or use [**bounty issue template**](ton-footstep-issue-template.md) as a reference to explain the goal of the proposal. Use the [**#217**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/217) issue as an example.
3. Ensure to examine the [**Telegram Bot**](https://t.me/footsteps_helper_bot), which, upon a single request, will generate a ready-to-use footstep in compliance with the predefined parameters, visible in the [**instructions for rapid footstep creation using ChatGPT**](https://t.me/thetontech/47).

**Review Stage**
1. The community can comment, discuss and suggest changes to the proposal.
2. TON Bounties [**committee**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#ton-footsteps-committee) regularly reviews proposals. The committee labels an issue `approved` if approved. Otherwise, they close it.
3. After receipt of the label `approved`, bounty is approved for implementation, but has not yet been assigned to the performer.
4. After discussing the amount of **reward**, **oriental release date** and the assignment of the performer(s), they can start performing the bounty.

**Completion stage**
1. Bounty performer finishes the task and verifies that all deliverables are completed.
2. Performer leaves a comment in the issue with following information:
* TON wallet address for reward.
* Results achieved.
* Name for the [**Hall of Fame**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#hall-of-fame).
3. The [**committee**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#ton-footsteps-committee) will review the work and distribute rewards.

## How to Complete a Bounty
1. Find a suitable task from the [**list of the approved issues and free from the performer**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aapproved+no%3Aassignee).
2. Propose your plan or just ask to assign yourself to the issue.
3. Follow next steps of [**Review and Completion stages**](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#how-to-propose-something-to-the-list).
